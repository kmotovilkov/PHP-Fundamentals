Exercise: Intro and Basic Syntax

1.	Ages
Write a program that determines whether based on the given age a person is: baby, child, teenager, adult, elder. The bounders are:
•	0-2 – baby; 
•	3-13 – child; 
•	14-19 – teenager;
•	20-65 – adult;
•	>=66 – elder; 
•	All the values are inclusive.
Examples
Input	Output
20	adult
1	baby
100	elder


2.	Division
You will be given an integer and you have to print on the console whether that number is divisible by the following numbers: 2, 3, 6, 7, 10. You should always take the bigger division. If the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 it is also divisible by 6 and you should print only the division by 6. If a number is divisible by 2 it is sometimes also divisible by 10 and you should print the division by 10. If the number is not divisible by any of the given numbers print “Not divisible”. Otherwise print "The number is divisible by {number}".
Examples
Input	Output
30	The number is divisible by 10
15	The number is divisible by 3
12	The number is divisible by 6
1643	Not divisible


3.	Vacation
You are given a group of people, type of the group, on which day of the week they are going to stay. Based on that information calculate how much they have to pay and print that price on the console. Use the table below. In each cell is the price for a single person. The output should look like that: "Total price: {price}". The price should be rounded to the second decimal point.
	Friday	Saturday	Sunday
Students	8.45	9.80	10.46
Business	10.90	15.60	16
Regular	15	20	22.50
There are also discounts based on some conditions:
•	Students – if the group is bigger than or equal to 30 people you should reduce the total price by 15%
•	Business – if the group is bigger than or equal to  100 people 10 of them can stay for free
•	Regular – if the group is bigger than or equal 10 and less than or equal to 20 reduce the total price by 5%
You should reduce the prices in that EXACT order
Examples
Input	Output
30
Students
Sunday	Total price: 266.73
40
Regular
Saturday	Total price: 800.00	


4.	Print and Sum
Write a program to display numbers from given start to given end and their sum. All the numbers will be integers. On the first line you will receive the start number, on the second the end number.
Examples
Input	Output
5
10	5 6 7 8 9 10
Sum: 45
0
26	0 1 2 … 26
Sum: 351
50
60	50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60
Sum: 605



5.	Login
You will be given a string representing a username. The password will be that username reversed. Until you receive the correct password print on the console "Incorrect password. Try again.". When you receive the correct password print "User {username} logged in." However on the fourth try if the password is still not correct print "User {username} blocked!" and end the program.
Examples
Input	Output
Acer
login
go
let me in
recA
	Incorrect password. Try again.
Incorrect password. Try again.
Incorrect password. Try again.
User Acer logged in.

momo
omom	User momo logged in.
sunny
rainy
cloudy
sunny
not sunny	Incorrect password. Try again.
Incorrect password. Try again.
Incorrect password. Try again.
User sunny blocked!



6.	Strong number
Write a program to check if a given number is a strong number or not. A number is strong if the sum of the Factorial of each digit is equal to the number. For example 145 is a strong number, because 1! + 4! + 5! = 145. Print "yes" if the number is strong and "no" if the number is not strong.
Examples
Input	Output
2	yes
3451	no
40585	yes



7.	Vending Machine
Your task is to calculate the total price of a purchase from a vending machine. Until you receive "Start" you will be given different coins that are being inserted in the machine. You have to sum them in order to have the total money inserted. There is a problem though. Your vending machine only works with 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 coins. If someone tries to insert some other coins you have to display "Cannot accept {money}" and not add it to the total money. On the next few lines until you receive "End" you will be given products to purchase. Your machine has however only "Nuts", "Water", "Crisps", "Soda", "Coke". The prices are: 2.0, 0.7, 1.5, 0.8, 1.0 respectively. If the person tries to purchase a not existing product print “Invalid product”. Be careful that the person may try to purchase a product they don’t have the money for. In that case print "Sorry, not enough money". If the person purchases a product successfully print "Purchased {product name}". After the "End" command print the money that are left formatted to the second decimal point in the format "Change: {money left}".
 
Examples
Input	Output
1
1
0.5
0.6
Start
Coke
Soda
Crisps
End	Cannot accept 0.6
Purchased coke
Purchased soda
Sorry, not enough money
Change: 0.70
Hint
You can use round() method with precision.

9.	*Padawan Equipment
Yoda is starting his newly created Jedi academy. So, he asked master Ivan Cho to buy the needed equipment. The number of items depends on how many students will sign up. The equipment for the Padawan contains lightsabers, belts and robes. 
You will be given the amount of money Ivan Cho has, the number of students and the prices of each item. You have to help Ivan Cho calculate if the money he has is enough to buy all of the equipment, or how much more money he needs. 
Because the lightsabres sometimes brake, Ivan Cho should buy 10% more, rounded up to the next integer. Also, every sixth belt is free. 
Input / Constraints
The input data should be read from the console. It will consist of exactly 5 lines:
•	The amount of money Ivan Cho has – floating-point number in range [0.00…1,000.00]
•	The count of students – integer in range [0…100]
•	The price of lightsabers for a single sabre – floating-point number in range [0.00…100.00]
•	The price of robes for a single robe – floating-point number in range [0.00…100.00]
•	The price of belts for a single belt – floating-point number in range [0.00…100.00]
The input data will always be valid. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output should be printed on the console.
•	If the calculated price of the equipment is less or equal to the money Ivan Cho has:
o	"The money is enough - it would cost {the cost of the equipment}lv."
•	If the calculated price of the equipment is more than the money Ivan Cho has:
o	 "Ivan Cho will need {neededMoney}lv more."
•	All prices must be rounded to two digits after the decimal point.
Examples
Input	Output	Comments
100
2
1.0
2.0
3.0	The money is enough - it would cost 13.00lv.	Needed equipment for 2 padawans  :
sabresPrice*(studentsCount + 10%) + robesPrice * (studentsCount) + beltsPrice*(studentsCount-freeBelts) 
1*(3) + 2*(2) + 3*(2) = 13.00
13.00 <= 100 – the money will be enough.
Input	Output	Comments
100
42
12.0
4.0
3.0	Ivan Cho will need 737.00lv more.	Needed equipment for 42 padawans:
12*47 + 4*42 + 3*35 = 837.00
837 > 100 – need 737.00 lv. more.



10.	*Rage Expenses
As a MOBA challenger player, Pesho has the bad habit to trash his PC when he loses a game and rage quits. His gaming setup consists of headset, mouse, keyboard and display. You will receive Pesho`s lost games count. 
Every second lost game, Pesho trashes his headset.
Every third lost game, Pesho trashes his mouse.
When Pesho trashes both his mouse and headset in the same lost game, he also trashes his keyboard.
Every second time, when he trashes his keyboard, he also trashes his display. 
You will receive the price of each item in his gaming setup. Calculate his rage expenses for renewing his gaming equipment. 
Input / Constraints
•	On the first input line - lost games count – integer in the range [0, 1000].
•	On the second line – headset price - floating point number in range [0, 1000]. 
•	On the third line – mouse price - floating point number in range [0, 1000]. 
•	On the fourth line – keyboard price - floating point number in range [0, 1000]. 
•	On the fifth line – display price - floating point number in range [0, 1000]. 
Output
•	As output you must print Pesho`s total expenses: "Rage expenses: {expenses} lv."
•	Allowed working time / memory: 100ms / 16MB.

11.	*Santa's Cookies
 You need to make cookies for Santa and his dwarfs. 
You will receive the amount of batches – n that you need to bake. For every batch you will receive ingredients:  flour, sugar and cocoa in grams, each on a new line. You need to calculate how many boxes of cookies you get for every batch with the given ingredients and total boxes of cookies for all batches. To calculate the number of boxes per batch you need to divide total cookies per bake by cookies per box (see the table below). To get the total cookies per bake use the following formula and round the result to the nearest lower number:  
({cup} + {smallSpoon} + {bigSpoon}) * min from({flourCups}, {sugarSpoons}, {cocoaSpoons}) / singleCookieGrams
To get the flourCups divide flour by cups.
To get the sugarSpoons divide sugar by bigSpoon. 
And for the cocoaSpoons divide cocoa by smallSpoon. 
The cups and the spoons must be integer numbers. 
(see the table below)
If flourCups, sugarSpoons or cocoaSpoons for a single bake are not enough (<=0), print the following message: "Ingredients are not enough for a box of cookies."
Otherwise calculate the cookies and print the number of boxes you get for the current batch:
  "Boxes of cookies: {boxes of cookies per current bake}"
Item	Grams
Single cookie Grams 	25
Cup	140
Small Spoon	10
Big Spoon	20
Cookies per Box	5
Use the following table for calculations:




When you finish baking, pack the all the cookies in boxes and send them to Santa and his dwarfs and print the total number of boxes on the console.  
"Total boxes: {totalBoxes for all bakes}"
Input
The input data should be read from the console. It will consist of:
•	Amount of batches - integer  number in range [0…1,000,000,000]
For every batch:
•	Amount of flour in grams – integer number in range [0…1,000]
•	Amount of sugar in grams – integer number in range [0…1,000]
•	Amount of cоcоа in grams – integer number in range [0…1,000]

The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output should be printed on the console.
•	If the ingredients for current bake are not enough:
"Ingredients are not enough for a box of cookies."
•	If the ingredients for current bake are enough:
"Boxes of cookies: {boxes of cookies per current bake}."
o	On the last line print: 
"Total boxes: {totalBoxes for all bakes}"
