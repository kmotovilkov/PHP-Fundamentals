
I.	Data Types and Type Conversion
1.	Integer Operations
Read four integer numbers. Add first to the second, divide (integer) the sum by the third number and multiply the result by the fourth number. Print the result.
Constraints 
•	First number will be in the range [-2,147,483,648… 2,147,483,647]
•	Second number will be in the range [-2,147,483,648… 2,147,483,647]
•	Third number will be in the range [-2,147,483,648… 2,147,483,647]
•	Fourth number will be in the range [-2,147,483,648… 2,147,483,647] 
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output
10
20
3
3
	30		15
14
2
3	42


2.	Circle Area (12 Digits Precision)
Write program to enter a radius r (real number) and prints the area of the circle with exactly 12 digits after the decimal point:
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output
2.5	19.634954084936		1.2	4.523893421169


3.	Elevator
Calculate how many courses will be needed to elevate n persons by using an elevator of capacity of p persons. The input holds two lines: the number of people n and the capacity p of the elevator.
Examples
Input	Output	Comments
17
3	6	5 courses * 3 people
+ 1 course * 2 persons
4
5	1	All the persons fit inside in the elevator.
Only one course is needed.
10
5	2	2 courses * 5 people
Hints
•	You should divide n by p. This gives you the number of full courses (e.g. 17 / 3 = 5).
•	If n does not divide p without a remainder, you will need one additional partially full course (e.g. 17 % 3 = 2).
•	Another approach is to round up n / p to the nearest integer (ceiling), e.g. 17/3 = 5.67  rounds up to 6.



4.	Centuries to Minutes
Write program to enter an integer number of centuries and convert it to years, days, hours and minutes.
Examples
Input	Output
1	1 centuries = 100 years = 36524 days = 876576 hours = 52594560 minutes
5	5 centuries = 500 years = 182621 days = 4382904 hours = 262974240 minutes
Hints
•	Use appropriate data type to fit the result after each data conversion.
•	Assume that a year has 365.2422 days at average (the Tropical year).


5.	Special Numbers
A number is special when its sum of digits is 5, 7 or 11.
Write a program to read an integer n and for all numbers in the range 1…n to print the number and if it is special or not (True / False).
Examples
Input	Output
15	1 -> False
2 -> False
3 -> False
4 -> False
5 -> True
6 -> False
7 -> True
8 -> False
9 -> False
10 -> False
11 -> False
12 -> False
13 -> False
14 -> True
15 -> False


6.	Triples of Latin Letters
Write a program to read an integer n and print all triples of the first n small Latin letters, ordered alphabetically:
Examples
Input	Output
3	aaa
aab
aac
aba
abb
abc
aca
acb
acc
baa
bab
bac
bba
bbb
bbc
bca
bcb
bcc
caa
cab
cac
cba
cbb
cbc
cca
ccb
ccc
Hint
Perform 3 nested loops from 0 to n-1. For each number num print its corresponding Latin letter as follows:
 
In asci "a" is equal to 97.


7.	Concat Names
Read two names and a delimiter. Print the names joined by the delimiter.
Examples
Input	Output
John
Smith
->	John->Smith
Jan
White
<->	Jan<->White
Linda
Terry
=>	Linda=>Terry
II.	Variables


8.	Refactor Volume of Pyramid 
You are given a working code that finds the volume of a pyramid. However, you should consider that the variables exceed their optimum span and have improper naming. Also, search for variables that have multiple purpose.
Code
Sample Code
<?php
$dul = $sh = $V = 0;
echo "Length: ";
$dul = floatval(readline());
echo "Width: ";
$sh = floatval(readline());
echo "Height: ";
$V = floatval(readline());
$v = ($dul * $sh * $V) / 3;
echo sprintf("Pyramid Volume: %.2f", $v) . PHP_EOL;
Hints
•	Reduce the span of the variables by declaring them in the moment they receive a value, not before
•	Rename your variables to represent their real purpose (example: "dul" should become length, etc.)
•	Search for variables that have multiple purpose. If you find any, introduce a new variable.
