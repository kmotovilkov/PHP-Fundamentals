
I.	Declaring and Invoking Functions
1.	Sign of Integer
Create a function that prints the sign of an integer number:
Example
Input	Output
2	The number 2 is positive.
-5	The number -5 is negative.
0	The number 0 is zero.


2.	Grades
Write a function that receives a grade between 2.00 and 6.00 and prints the corresponding grade in words
•	2.00 – 2.99 - "Fail"
•	3.00 – 3.49 - "Poor"
•	3.50 – 4.49 - "Good"
•	4.50 – 5.49 - "Very good"
•	5.50 – 6.00 - "Excellent"
Examples
Input	Output
3.33	Poor
4.50	Very good
2.99	Fail
Hint
Read the grade from the console and pass it to a function:
  
Then create the function and make the if statements for each case: 


3.	Calculations
Write a program that receives a string on the first line (add, multiply, subtract, divide) and on the next two lines receives two numbers. Create four functions (for each calculation) and invoke the right one depending on the command. The function should also print the result.
Example
Input	Output
subtract
5
4	1
divide
8
4	2
Hints
Read the command on the first line and the two numbers, and then make an if/switch statement for each type of calculation
 
Then create the four functions and print the result.


4.	Printing Triangle
Create a function for printing triangles as shown below:
Examples
Input	Output
3	1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2
1
4	1
1 2
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1
Hints
1.	After you read the input
2.	Start by creating a function for printing a single line from a given start to a given end. Choose a meaningful name for it, describing its purpose:
 
3.	Think how you can use it to solve the problem
4.	After you spent some time thinking, you should have come to the conclusion that you will need two loops
5.	In the first loop you can print the first half of the triangle without the middle line:
 
6.	Next, print the middle line:
 
7.	Lastly, print the rest of the triangle:
 
 
 
5.	Orders
Write a function that calculates the total price of an order and prints it on the console. The function should receive one of the following products: coffee, coke, water, snacks; and a quantity of the product. The prices for a single piece of each product are: 
•	coffee – 1.50
•	water – 1.00
•	coke – 1.40
•	snacks – 2.00
Print the result rounded to the second decimal place.
Example
Input	Output
water
5	5.00
Coffee
2	3.00
Hint
•	Read the first two lines
•	Create a function the pass the two variables in
•	Print the result in the functions
II.	Returning Values



6.	Calculate Rectangle Area
Create a function that calculates and returns the area of a triangle by given width and length:
Examples
Input	Output
3
4	12



7.	Math Power
Create a function that calculates and returns the value of a number raised to a given power:
Examples
Input	Output
2
8	256
3
4	81
Hints
1.	As usual, read the input
2.	Create a function which will have two parameters - the number and the power


8.	Factorial
You are given number n as input. Your task is to write an assigning anonymous function that calculate n factorial and return it.
Constrains
•	The integer n will be in range [0, 100].
Examples
Input	Output
1	1
5	120
25
	15511210043330985984000000
	
	
	
9.	Multiply Evens by Odds
Create a program that reads an integer number and multiplies the sum of all its even digits by the sum of all its odd digits:
Examples
Input	Output	Comments
12345	54	12345 has 2 even digits - 2 and 4. Even digits has sum of 6.
Also it has 3 odd digits - 1, 3 and 5. Odd digits has sum of 9.
Multiply 6 by 9 and you get 54.
-12345	54	
Hints
1.	Create a function with a name describing its purpose (like getMultipleOfEvensAndOdds). The function should have a single integer parameter and an integer return value. Also, the function will call two other functions:
 
2.	Create a function getSumOfEvenDigits()
3.	Create getSumOfOddDigits()
4.	As you test your solution you may notice that it doesn't work for negative numbers. Following the program execution line by line, find and fix the bug (hint: you can use abs())



10.	Repeat String
Write a function that receives a string and a repeat count n (integer). The function should return a new string (the old one repeated n times)
Example
Input	Output
abc
3	abcabcabc
String
2	StringString
Hints
Firstly read the string and the repeat count n
Then create the function and pass it the variables
 
 
11.	Math operations
Write a function that receives two number and an operator, calculates the result and returns it. You will be given three lines of input. The first will be the first number, the second one will be the operator and the last one will be the second number. The possible operators are: "/", "*", "+", "-"
Print the result rounded up to the second decimal point.
 

Example
Input	Output
5
*
5	25.00
4
+
8	12.00

7
/
2	3.50
Hint
Read the inputs and create a function that returns a floating point number (the result of the operation)
 
III.	Forms


12.	Hello, Person!
Write a program which receives a name from a form and prints in the html the following greeting (after your click on the [Submit] button). The form should disappear after clicking the input:
•	"Hello, {name}!"
You should read the name from the following form:
<form>
    Name: <input type="text" name="person" />
    <input type="submit" />
</form>
Examples



13.	Multiply Two Numbers
You are given an integer number num1 and an integer number num2. Write a PHP script that multiplies num1 * num2 and prints the result. The input comes as parameters named num1 and num2.
Print the output in the HTML page.
Skeleton
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>PHP Form</title>

</head>
<body>
<form>
    N: <input type="text" name="num1"/>
    M: <input type="text" name="num2"/>
    <input type="submit"/>
</form>
<!--Write your PHP Script here-->
</body>
</html>

Examples
Parameters names	Input	Output	

	Input	Output
num1	2	6		13	169
num2	3			13		
Hints
•	This time the form which will be given to use will have 2 input elements, with names num1 and num2 
•	We must check both elements, if they have values before we perform any action
 
•	When we have checked both elements we get them both and extract their values into variables and we perform the specified action:
 
•	The result is as follows:
•	 
•
