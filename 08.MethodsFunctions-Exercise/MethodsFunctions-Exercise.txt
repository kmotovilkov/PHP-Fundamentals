4.	Password Validator
Write a program that checks if a given password is valid. Password rules are:
•	6 – 10 characters (inclusive)
•	Consists only of letters and digits
•	Have at least 2 digits 
If a password is valid print “Password is valid”. If it is not valid, for every unfulfilled rule print a message:
•	"Password must be between 6 and 10 characters"
•	"Password must consist only of letters and digits"
•	"Password must have at least 2 digits"
Examples
Input	Output
logIn	Password must be between 6 and 10 characters
Password must have at least 2 digits
MyPass123	Password is valid
Pa$s$s	Password must consist only of letters and digits
Password must have at least 2 digits
Hints
Write a function for each rule.


5.	Add and Subtract
You will receive 3 integers. Write a function sum to get the sum of the first two integers and subtract function that subtracts the third integer from the result from the Sum function. 
Examples
Input	Output

6.	Middle Characters
You will receive a single string. Write a function that prints the middle character. If the length of the string is even there are two middle characters.
Examples
Input	Output
aString	r
someText	eT
3245	24


7.	NxN Matrix

8.	Factorial Division
Read two integer numbers. Calculate factorial of each number. Divide the first result by the second and print the division formatted to the second decimal point.
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output
5
2
	60.00		6
2	360.00


9.	Palindrome Integers
A palindrome is a number which reads the same backward as forward, such as 323 or 1001. Write a program which reads a positive integer numbers until you receive "End", for each number print whether the number is palindrome or not.
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output
123
323
421
121
END	false
true
false
true		32

1010
END	false
true
true
false


10.	Top Number
A top number is an integer that holds the following properties:
•	Its sum of digits is divisible by 8, e.g. 8, 16, 88.
•	Holds at least one odd digit, e.g. 232, 707, 87578.
Write a program to print all master numbers in the range [1…n].
