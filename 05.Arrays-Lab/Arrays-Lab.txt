Lab: Arrays


1.	Day of Week
Enter a day number [1…7] and print the day name (in English) or “Invalid Day!“. Use an array of strings.
Examples
Input	Output
1	Monday
2	Tuesday
7	Sunday
0	Invalid Day!



2.	Print Numbers in Reverse Order
Read n numbers and print them in reverse order. 
Examples
Input	Output
3
10
20
30	30 20 10
3
30
20
10	10 20 30
1
10	10



3.	Rounding Numbers
Read an array of real numbers (space separated), round them in "away from 0" style and print the output as in the example: "0.90 => 1". "0.90" is rounded to the second decimal place.
?
Examples
Input	Output
0.9 1.5 2.4 2.5 3.14	0.90 => 1
1.50 => 2
2.40 => 2
2.50 => 3
3.14 => 3
-5.01 -1.599 -2.5 -1.50 0	-5.01 => -5
-1.60 => -2
-2.50 => -3
-1.50 => -2
0.00 => 0
Hints
To round "away from 0" use round() method. By default the method's rounding mode is away from 0.



4.	Reverse an Array of Strings
Write a program to read an array of strings, reverse it and print its elements. The input consists of a sequence of space separated strings. Print the output on a single line (space separated).
Examples
Input	Output
a b c d e	e d c b a
-1 hi ho w	w ho hi -1



5.	Sum Even Numbers
Read an array from the console and sum only the even numbers.
Examples
Input	Output
1 2 3 4 5 6	12
3 5 7 9	0
2 4 6 8 10	30



6.	Even and Odd Subtraction
Write a program that calculates the difference between the sum of the even and the sum of the odd numbers in an array.
Examples
Input	Output	Comments
1 2 3 4 5 6	3	2 + 4 + 6 = 12
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
12 – 9 = 3
3 5 7 9	-24	
2 4 6 8 10	30


	
7.	Equal Arrays
Read two arrays and print on the console whether they are identical or not. Arrays are identical if their elements are equal. If the arrays are identical find the sum of the first one and print on the console following message: "Arrays are identical. Sum: {sum}", otherwise find the first index where the arrays differ and print on the console following message: "Arrays are not identical. Found difference at {index} index".
Examples
Input	Output
10 20 30
10 20 30	Arrays are identical. Sum: 60
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 4 3 5	Arrays are not identical. Found difference at 2 index
1
10	Arrays are not identical. Found difference at 0 index


8.	Condense Array to Number
Write a program to read an array of integers and condense them by summing adjacent couples of elements until a single integer is obtained. For example, if we have 3 elements {2, 10, 3}, we sum the first two and the second two elements and obtain {2+10, 10+3} = {12, 13}, then we sum again all adjacent elements and obtain {12+13} = {25}.
Examples
Input	Output	Comments
2 10 3	25	2 10 3 ? 2+10 10+3 ? 12 13 ? 12 + 13 ? 25
5 0 4 1 2	35	5 0 4 1 2 ? 5+0 0+4 4+1 1+2 ? 5 4 5 3 ? 5+4 4+5 5+3 ? 9 9 8 ? 9+9 9+8 ? 18 17 ? 18+17 ? 35
1	1	1 is already condensed to number
